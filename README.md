🚀 ***Key Features***


🧠 **AI-Driven Input Understanding**

Natural Language Input: Type sentences like “What is the integral of x² from 0 to 2?” and the system converts them into a solvable mathematical form.

Handwritten Drawing Recognition: Draw equations on a canvas — the backend uses Google Vision OCR to extract symbols and convert them into math.

Image Upload Capability: Upload photos of handwritten notes or textbook equations for automatic interpretation.
